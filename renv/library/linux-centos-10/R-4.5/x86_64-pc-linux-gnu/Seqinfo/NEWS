SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The Seqinfo class was moved from the GenomeInfoDb package to the
      new Seqinfo package.

      IMPORTANT WARNING: This means that:

      - Seqinfo-holding S4 objects that were serialized before this change
        (i.e. prior to Bioconductor 3.22) are no longer valid objects in
        Bioconductor >= 3.22. However they can be fixed with updateObject().

      - This also means that Seqinfo-holding S4 objects serialized with
        Bioconductor >= 3.22 are no longer valid objects in Bioconductor
        < 3.22. These objects can **not** be fixed with updateObject().
