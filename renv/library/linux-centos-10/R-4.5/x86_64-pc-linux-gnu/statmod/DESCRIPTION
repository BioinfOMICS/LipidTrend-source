Description: A collection of algorithms and functions to aid statistical modeling. Includes limiting dilution analysis (aka ELDA), growth curve comparisons, mixed linear models, heteroscedastic regression, inverse-Gaussian probability calculations, Gauss quadrature and a secure convergence algorithm for nonlinear models. Also includes advanced generalized linear model functions including Tweedie and Digamma distributional families, secure convergence and exact distributional calculations for unit deviances.
