VERSION 1.10.0
--------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Drop dependency on the crayon package.


VERSION 1.8.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o arep_times() and arep_each(): multidimensional versions of
      base::rep( , times=) and base::rep( , each=).

    o as_tile(): a convenient way to control the direction of recycling in
      the context of arithmetic and other binary operations between an array
      and a vector, or between two arrays of distinct dimensions.
      Still work-in-progress!

    o kronecker() methods for Array objects that work out-of-the-box on Array
      derivatives that support [ and *.


VERSION 1.6.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add fast colsum() method for ordinary matrices.

    o Define low-level generics:
        - subset_Array_by_logical_array()
        - subset_Array_by_Lindex()
        - subset_Array_by_Mindex()
        - subset_Array_by_Nindex()
      with default methods. Their purpose is to support subsetting (`[`)
      of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
      extensions to implement subsetting for their objects.
      They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

    o Define low-level generics:
        - subassign_Array_by_logical_array()
        - subassign_Array_by_Lindex()
        - subassign_Array_by_Mindex()
        - subassign_Array_by_Nindex()
      with default methods. Their purpose is to support subassignment (`[<-`)
      of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
      extensions to implement subassignment for their objects.
      They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o read_block() now uses SparseArray::extract_sparse_array() instead of
      DelayedArray::OLD_extract_sparse_array() behind the scene to extract
      and load sparse blocks from a sparse array-like object. As a consequence,
      sparse blocks are now returned as SparseArray objects (implemented in
      the SparseArray package) instead of SparseArraySeed objects (implemented
      in the DelayedArray package).


VERSION 1.4.0
-------------

- No changes in this version.


VERSION 1.2.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add abind() generic + default method.

    o Add drop() method and dim() setter for Array objects.


VERSION 1.0.0
-------------

    o First version of the package that is ready for general use.
